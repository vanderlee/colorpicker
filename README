			rgb(rrr%,ggg%,bbb%)
			rgba(rrr%,ggg%,bbb%,aaa%)

	colorFormat:		'HEX'
		Specifies the format of the color string returned in callbacks.
		You can either specify one of the predefined formats:
			HEX		#123456
			HEX3	#135 (rounds colors)
			RGBA	rgb(123,45,67) or rgba(123,45,67,0.123%)

			HSLA%	hsl(12%,34%,56%) or hsla(12%,34%,56%,0.123%)
		or specify your own format...
		Each color channel is specified as a pair of two characters.
		The first character determines the color channel:
			r, g, b, a, h, s or v.
		The second character specifies the data type:
			x			Two-digit hexadecimal notation.
			d			Decimal (0-255) notation.
			f			Floating point (0-1) notation, not rounded.
			p			Percentage (0-100) notation, not rounded.
		If you prefix a valid pair with a backslash, it won't be replaced.
		All patterns are case sensitive.
		For example, to create the common hex color format, use "#rxgxbx".
		For an rgba() format, use "rgba(rd,gd,bd,af)"
