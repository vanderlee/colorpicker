*	``#HEX3``	#123 (#RGB) if possible, otherwise false.
*	``HEX``		112233 (RRGGBB)
*	``HEX3``	123 (RGB) if possible, otherwise false.
*	``#HEXA``	#11223344 (#RRGGBBAA)

*	``NAME``	Closest color name
*	``EXACT``	Exact name if possible, otherwise false.

or specify your own format...
Each color channel is specified as a pair of two characters.
The first character determines the color channel:

*	``a``			Alpha
*	``r, g, b``		RGB color space; red, green and blue
*	``h, s, v``		HSV color space; hue, saturation and value
*	``c, m, y, k``	CMYK color space; cyan, magenta, yellow and black
*	``L, A, B``		LAB color space; Luminosity, *A and *B.

The second character specifies the data type:

*	``x``			Two-digit hexadecimal notation.
*	``d``			Decimal (0-255) notation.
*	``f``			Floating point (0-1) notation, not rounded.
*	``p``			Percentage (0-100) notation, not rounded.

If you prefix a valid pair with a backslash, it won't be replaced.
All patterns are case sensitive.
For example, to create the common hex color format, use "#rxgxbx".
For an rgba() format, use "rgba(rd,gd,bd,af)"

You can also specify an array of formats where the first non-FALSE one
is returned. Note that the only formats able to return FALSE are the
predefined formats HEX3 and EXACT. For example, this array will output
HEX3 format if possible or HEX format otherwise:

*	``['HEX3', 'HEX']``

###	draggable (true)
Make the dialog draggable if the header is visible and the dialog is
not inline.

###	containment (null)
If the dialog is draggable, constrains dragging to within the bounds of the
specified element or region. Same as jQueryUI Draggable.

###	duration ('fast')
Same as jQueryUI DatePicker.

###	hsv (true)
Whether or not to show the inputs for HSV.

###	inline (true)
If set to false, attaching to a non-input will still make the dialog
a popup instead of inline. Make sure you handle events to catch the
color change, otherwise you can't use the color.

###	inlineFrame (true)
If enabled, shows a border and background when inline. Disabling may
allow closer integration.

###	layout ({ ... })
Set the position of elements in a table layout.
You could create any layout possible with HTML tables by specifying
cell position and size of each part.
@todo document how this works.

###	limit ('')
Limit the selectable colors to any of the predefined limits:

*	``''``		No limitations, allow 8bpp color for a palette of all 16 million colors.
*	``websafe``	Set of 216 colors composed of 00, 33, 66, 99, cc and ff color channel values in #rrggbb.
*	``nibble``	4 bits per color, can be easily converted to #rgb format. The palette is limited to 4096 colors.
*	``binary``	Allow only #00 or #ff as color channel values for primary colors only; only 8 colors are available with this limit.
*	``name``	Limit to closest color name.

###	modal (false)
Ensures no other controls on screen can be used while the dialog is
opened.
Also look at showCancelButton and closeOnEscape to use in combination
with the modal option. closeOnOutside is redundant when used with modal.

###	mode ('h')
Determines the functionality of the map and bar components. Allowed
values are; 'h', 's', 'l', 'r', 'g', 'b' or 'a', for hue, saturation,
luminosity, red, green, blue and alpha respectively.

###	okOnEnter (false)
Close the window when pressing the Enter key on the keyboard, keeping the selected color.

### part
Use the part option to specify options specific to parts (including plugin parts).
By default, the following part options are available:

###	parts ('')
Determine which parts to display.
Use any of the preset names ('full', 'popup' or 'inline') or specify an array
of part names (i.e. ['header', 'map', 'bar', 'hex', 'hsv',
'rgb', 'alpha', 'lab', 'cmyk', 'preview', 'swatches', 'footer']).
If an empty string is given, the parts will be automatically chosen as
preset 'popup' or 'inline' depending on the context in which the
colorpicker is used.

###	position (null)
Specify the position of the dialog as a jQueryUI position object.
See [jQueryUI .position() API documentation](http://api.jqueryui.com/position/)
for information on how to use.
ColorPicker adds an additional option to the `of` option; the value `'element'`
will refer to the element to which the ColorPicker is attached, including if it
is invisible).
By default, the dialog will attached to the bottom-left of the element, flipping
on collision.

###	regional ('')
Sets the language to use. Note that you must load the appropriate language file
from the i18n directory. '' is included by default.

### revert (false)
If enabled, closing the dialog through any means but the OK button will revert
the color back to the previous state, as if pressing the Cancel button.
The revert option changes the behaviour of the [X] button in the header, the
Escape keyboard button and clicking outside the dialog, when any of these
features are enabled.

###	rgb (true)
Whether or not to show the inputs for RGB.

###	selectOnMouseMove (true)
Triggers the 'select' event each time the mouse is moved on the colorpicker.
Set to false, to only trigger on mouse button release.

###	showAnim ('fadeIn')
Same as jQueryUI DatePicker.

###	showCancelButton (true)
Show the Cancel button if buttonpane is visible.

###	showCloseButton (true)
Show the Close button if the header is visible.
If the dialog is inline, the close button is never shown.

###	showNoneButton (false)
Show the None/Revert button if buttonpane is visible.

###	showOn ('focus click alt')
Specifies what user events will show the
colorpicker if not inline. Specify multiple events by seperating with
space.
Optionally 'focus', 'click', 'alt', 'button' and/or 'both'

*	``focus``	When the element comes into focus (either tab or click)
*	``click``	When the element is clicked (for non-inputs)
*	``alt``		When clicking on an element specified with as altField
*	``button``	When clicking on the button created if this event is specified.
*	``both``	selects all possible triggers

###	showOptions ({})
Same as jQueryUI DatePicker.

###	swatches (null)
'null' to show swatches of HTML colors or provide your own object
with colornames and {r:1, g:1, b:1} array.
For example { 'red': {r:1, g:0, b:0}, 'blue': {r:0, g:0, b:1} }
Alternatively, load a predefined set of swatches and specify the name.
For example, for the pantone set, specify 'pantone'.

###	swatchesWidth (84)
Width of the swatches display in pixels.

###	title (null)
Title to display in the header. If null, use language default.

Events
------
###	init(formatted, colorPicker)
Triggered on initially setting the color. Called only once.
Callbacks recieve same data as select event.

###	close(formatted, colorPicker)
Triggered when the popup is closed.
Callbacks recieve same data as select event and an additional number
of fields containing the current color in all supported color spaces.
These are rgb{}, hsv{}, cmyk{}, lab{}, hsl{} and a.
Most values are floating point numbers in range [0,1] for accuracy.
The a and b values in the lab color space have range [-1,1].

###	select(formatted, colorPicker)
Triggered on each change, confirmation (click on OK button) and
cancellation (click on Cancel, outside window or window close button)
respectively.

The event recieves a jQuery event object, a data object containing the elements
'formatted' (with the color formatted according to formatColor) and the
Colorpicker element that triggered the event.

Note that select may be triggered in rapid succession when dragging
the mouse accross the map or bar and may be triggered without a change
in color upon specific user interactions.

If no match is found, nothing is returned and the next parser is tried.
Parsers are tried in order of appearance.

Included plugins:
*	``cmyk-parser``				Parses a ``cmyk(c, y, m, k)`` format, similar to rgba.
*	``cmyk-percentage-parser``	Parses a ``cmyk(c%, y%, m%, k%)`` format with percentages.

###	parts
You can add additional visual parts, usually controls, that interact
with the rest of Colorpicker framework.

Included plugins:
*	``memory``		Cookie-based memory nodes.
*	``rgbsliders``	Set of three red/green/blue sliders with dynamically adjusted gradients.

###	partslists
Partslists are a convenient way to select multiple parts at once without having to specify each one individually.

No plugins included.

###	regional
Regional (in the i18n directory) plugins contain localized texts
(a.k.a. translations). A number of languages is provided.

Included regionals:
*	``de``		German (Deutsch).

Objects
-------
Colorpicker uses a Color object internally to represent a color and convert
between the supported color models.
You can create a new Color object through $.colorpicker.Color.
